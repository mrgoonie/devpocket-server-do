This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

DevPocket Server is a production-ready FastAPI backend for a mobile-first cloud IDE. It provides secure, scalable development environments accessible from mobile devices using DigitalOcean droplets. The system manages user authentication, development environments (droplets with SSH access), and real-time terminal access via WebSocket-to-SSH bridge.

## Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```

```

## Key Architectural Patterns

**Dependency Injection**: FastAPI's `Depends()` system is used throughout for database connections, authentication, and service injection. Services require `set_database()` calls to initialize database connections.

**Async/Await**: All I/O operations are asynchronous using Motor (async MongoDB driver), httpx for external API calls, and asyncssh for SSH connections to droplets.

**Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic is separated into service classes (`auth_service`, `environment_service`, `digitalocean_service`) that are injected into API routes.

**Settings Management**: Configuration uses Pydantic Settings with environment variable support. Settings are centralized in `app.core.config.Settings`, including DigitalOcean API tokens and configurations.

**Security Middleware Chain**: Multiple middleware layers handle security (rate limiting, CORS, security headers) before requests reach route handlers.

**SSH Bridge Pattern**: WebSocket connections are bridged to SSH connections for direct droplet access, providing native terminal experience.

## Environment Management with DigitalOcean

The application uses DigitalOcean droplets for development environments:

**Droplet Architecture**: Each environment is a dedicated DigitalOcean droplet with full SSH access, persistent block storage, and cloud-init configuration.

**Environment Lifecycle**:
- Droplets are created via DigitalOcean API with cloud-init scripts
- SSH keys are injected for secure access
- Tmux sessions persist across connections in `/home/devpocket/.tmux/`
- Block storage volumes provide data persistence

**Cloud-Init Initialization**: Startup scripts are embedded in cloud-init user-data, including package installation, tmux setup, and environment configuration.

**SSH Bridge**: WebSocket connections are bridged to SSH connections, providing direct PTY access to the droplet terminal.

**Template Management**: Templates are stored as YAML files in `./scripts/templates/` with cloud-init configurations and can be loaded into the database using `scripts/load_templates.py`.

## DigitalOcean Integration Details

**API Token**: Stored in `DO_API_TOKEN` environment variable
**SSH Keys**: Managed per-user and injected into droplets during creation
**Regions**: Configurable default region with support for all DO regions
**Sizes**: Mapped to subscription tiers (free: s-1vcpu-512mb, starter: s-1vcpu-1gb, pro: s-2vcpu-2gb)
**Volumes**: Attached block storage for persistent data

## Development rules

- always update the related docs in `./docs` folder if the code changes affect the docs
- use `source venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment before running any command
